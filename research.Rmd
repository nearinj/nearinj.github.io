My research focuses on analyzing microbiome sequencing data to better understand the relationships between microbial agents and host phenotypes, including diseases such as cancer or dietary changes such as low carbohydrate diets. I also dedicate significant effort to developing and evaluating bioinformatic tools and workflows for the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic shotgun sequencing data.


I have worked on a variety of microbiome based research projects that have studied:


<ul>

<li>	Microbial genomics </li>
<li>  Differential Abundance </li>
<li>  Processing 16S rRNA gene sequencing data  </li>
<li>  Oral microbiome and cancer </li>
<li>  Companion animal microbiomes </li>
<li>  Bias in microbiome sequencing studies </li>
<li>  Multi-omic data analysis </li>
</ul>



Other general topics I am intersted in include:

<ul>

<li>	Microbial evolution </li>
<li>  Machine Learning </li>
<li>  High dimensional data analysis </li>
<li>  Data visualization </li>
<li> Virology </li>
</ul>


I welcome comments and questions about my work and greatly value collaboration. Please feel free to contact me. For more information on my projects, visit my [CV](CV.html).
